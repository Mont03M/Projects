Rat-N-Maze Program

The following program was created in C# and solves the rat-n-maze problem using recursion to improve its search to navigate an 8x8 maze. The maze is hard coded, future versions of the project will contain methods to randomized the construction of a maze. So, that on each iteration the maze will be generated differently, highlighting the capabilities of the algorithms towards finding the end of the maze.

All that is needed to run the program is to download the files and execute the program in a Microsoft Visual Studio IDE or similar IDEs that can execute C# code.
